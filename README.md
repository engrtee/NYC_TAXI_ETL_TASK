# 🚕 NYC Taxi Data ETL Pipeline (SQL + Python)

This project is an **End-to-End ETL Pipeline** built to demonstrate how the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold)** works in practice using **SQL Server** and **Python**.

It was inspired by a real-world challenge from the **Data Engineering Community (DEC)**, where participants were tasked to build and deploy a data pipeline for the NYC Taxi dataset.

Although this version focuses on a **Full Load**, it lays the foundation for incremental loads, data validation, and transformation logic.
